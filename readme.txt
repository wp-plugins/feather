== Description ==

Feather is a lightweight and powerful WordPress theme framework by [WPBandit](http://wpbandit.com). The framework allows you to easily configure your theme using the WordPress Dashboard and multiple configuration files.

#### Getting Started

**Feather Folder**

Before activating the plugin you should create a **feather** folder in your themeâ€™s directory. The framework will not initialize without this folder.

**Core Config File**

You will also need to create a **config** folder inside of the feather folder. This file should be named **feather-config.php**. You can create an empty file for now.

== Installation ==

1. Upload feather to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Create a _feather_ folder in your theme's directory.
3. Create a _config_ folder inside the _feather_ directory.
4. Create an empty feather-config.php file in the _config_ directory.
