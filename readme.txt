Feather is a lightweight and powerful WordPress theme framework. Easily configure your theme using a configuration file.

== Description ==

Feather is a lightweight and powerful WordPress theme framework by [WPBandit](http://wpbandit.com). The framework allows you to easily configure your theme using the WordPress Dashboard and multiple configuration files.

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

There are two quick things you need to do before your theme can use the framework:

**Feather Folder** : Before activating the plugin you should create a **feather** folder in your themeâ€™s directory. The framework will not initialize without this folder.

**Feather Config File** : You will also need to create a **config** folder inside of the feather folder. This file should be named **feather-config.php**. You can create an empty file for now.

<h4>Additional Information</h4>

Visit Feather's [website](http://banditmedia.github.com/feather/) for more information.

== Installation ==

To quickly get going follow the instructions below:

1. Upload feather to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Create a **feather** folder in your theme's directory.
3. Create a **config** folder inside the _feather_ directory.
4. Create an empty **feather-config.php** file in the _config_ directory.
5. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
